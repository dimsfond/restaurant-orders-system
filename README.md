## Business Problem
Restaurants often manage orders manually, with papernotes or verbal handoffs. This method causes wrong orders, delays, billing mistakes and consequently, unhappy customers

## Users/Stakeholders
- **Waiters** : create and update orders for customers
- **Kitchen Stuff** : see the orders that come through, update their status from PPEPARING to READY
- **Cashiers** : complete payments that correspond to each order they see
- **Manager** : review sales and history

## Manual Process that is being automated
- Waiters take orders from the customers and pass them to the kitchen stuff through paper notes or verbally
- Kitchen stuff mark items/order as ready again verbally
- Cashiers read the paper of the order to complete the payment
- The manager keeps spreadsheets for daily totals

## Pain points adressed by my system
- Lost or unreadable paper notes by the waiters or the kitchen stuff.
- Items miscommunicated to the kitchen
- No live order status visibility
- Manual calculations of payments that are prone to errors
- No history for orders and daily totals
